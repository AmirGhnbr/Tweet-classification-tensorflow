# build Tweet classification using tensorflow

This project aims to classify a particular tweet is related to disaster or not.

throughout of this notebook we will use jupyter notebook , pandas , numpy, matplotlib , scikit-learn(when its needed) and Tensorflow.

## Guides to install required packages and set up your local development environment

**set up local environment:**

- Use miniconda(not a good option take up lots of space almost 1.5GB)

**You can also use cloud development enviroments as well:**

- Use google colab <a href="https://research.google.com/colaboratory" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

### Miniconda

first you need to install for your OS [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

#### For macOS & Windows

- for windows you need to open up the Anaconda prompt and write the following commands on it.

- for macOS users you need to open up the terminal

* Run Following command to make sure miniconda installed properly

```sh
conda --version
```

if you see the version number you are good to go otherwise you need to troubleshoot your installation

- To create project folder use the command below

```sh
mkdir <project-folder-name>
```

- Change the directory into it

```sh
cd <project-folder-name>
```

- Create conda environment

```sh
conda create --prefix ./env jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

- Activate conda

```sh
conda activate <full-path-of-project/env>
```

- Open jupyter notebook

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

if you downloaded the notebook to your project folder now you should use the notebook.
